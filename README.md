# loafkit

**loafkit** is a playful, cozy, and themeable Svelte 5 ecosystem designed to help you build web applications with personality 

### The Ecosystem

* **loafkit** *(coming soon...)* — A full SvelteKit starter template. It comes as a pre-configured, ready-to-build site for when you want the initial boilerplate and framework setup done for you.

* **loafkit UI** *(available now @ciabi/loafkit)* — the cozy, themeable component library for Svelte 5. 

  * it powers the Loafkit starter template, but you can use it on its own if you prefer building your project from scratch (or adding components to an existing app).

## Loafkit UI

This repository houses **Loafkit UI**. Install `@ciabi/loafkit-ui` to start using its components and styles:

```sh
npm install @ciabi/loafkit-ui
```

> **Upgrading from `@ciabi/loaf-web`?**  
> Existing projects using `@ciabi/loaf-web` do not need to change anything. Both package names receive identical updates, support the exact same component imports, and share CSS subpaths.

Check out the [Package README](./package/README.md) for full setup instructions. We dont have a documentation (yet)

## development

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

the root route is the component gallery and manual regression page. `src/lib` contains the library
source, and `npm run package` builds the files published to npm.

before a release, run `npm run quality` and `npm run smoke:consumer`. the smoke check packs and
installs both npm names from the same build. see [RELEASING.md](./RELEASING.md) for the first
dual-name release setup and later releases.
